    "\n",
    "In this notebook, an employee attrition dataset is used. You start by doing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data. Then a model is trained using `sklearn`. The model is used to make predictions and evaluate the model to determine how well it generalizes to new data. Then you use machine learning explainability (MLX) to understand the global and local model behavior. You do all of this using the Oracle Accelerated Data Science (`ADS`) library.\n",

    "It is great to have an expert with knowledge of what a model should do. However, this is often not available. Models sometimes learn different things than what an expert would speculate should be learned. Generally, models learn important relationships between the data. For many machine learning models, it is difficult or almost impossible to understand what the model has learned. The `ADSExplainer` provides a powerful set of tools that provides the data scientist insight into what a complex model is doing. It does this by building other models and performing simulations on the model's predictions. From this, the `ADSExplainer` learns what has been learned.\n",
